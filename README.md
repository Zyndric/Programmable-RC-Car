Programmable-RC-Car
===================

Arduino + $9 RC Car + $9 Parts = Programmable RC Car  

Any RC car can be hacked and made programmable.  
This project is great for electronics beginners and requires some soldering to build a 
simple Arduino shield used to control the car.  Pulse width modulation (PWM) is used for 
speed control.

This version has been extended to record motion patterns. When using the GUI,
start recording with the [R] key, drive some time ([W] [A] [S] [D] or
arrow keys), then press [SPACE] to stop recording. When a pattern has been
recorded, play [P] to start playback, [SPACE] again to stop it.

The recorder has been extended to even record hardware key presses,
enabling you to use the remote control buttons for recording sessions.
